Quick question: Do you track your rest periods?

Most people track sets, reps, and weight.

But rest periods? They ignore them completely.

Here's why that's a problem:

→ Too short = incomplete recovery = weaker sets
→ Too long = losing muscle activation = wasted time

The sweet spot for most goals:
• Strength: 3-5 minutes
• Hypertrophy: 60-90 seconds
• Conditioning: 30-45 seconds

This ONE change can improve your results by 20-30%.

You're doing everything "right":

✓ Hitting the gym 4x/week
✓ Eating healthy
✓ Staying consistent

But the scale won't budge. Sound familiar?

Here's what's probably happening:

You're under-recovering.

Your body builds muscle during REST, not during training.

Think of it like this:
Training = tearing down
Recovery = building back stronger

If you're constantly tearing down without proper recovery, you're just spinning your wheels.

The fix:
→ 7-9 hours of sleep (non-negotiable)
→ 120-150g protein daily
→ 2-3 true rest days per week
→ Manage your stress

I know it's not sexy. But it works.

Try this for 3 weeks and watch what happens.

Want to know the real secret to sustainable fitness?

It's not sexy. It's not complicated.

It's the 80/20 rule.

Here's how I apply it:

🎯 80% whole foods, 20% whatever I want
🎯 80% consistent training, 20% flexibility
🎯 80% on point, 20% life happens

This keeps me:
→ Sane
→ Social
→ Sustainable

The people who try to be 100% perfect?

They burn out. Every. Single. Time.

The people who embrace 80/20?

They're still crushing it 5 years later.

Life's too short to be miserable over broccoli.

Aim for progress, not perfection.
